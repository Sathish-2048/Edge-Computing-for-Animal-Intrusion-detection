# Edge Computing for Animal Intrusion detection
Animal intrusion into agricultural fields and residential areas is one among those threats that results in crop losses, property damage, and serious economic losses for farmers. Various methods to detect and prevent animal intrusion had evolved over time. This research introduces one such method to detect Animal intrusion utilizing the powerful YOLOv8 model, trained on a custom dataset, that was developed by choosing target animals, collecting their realtime images based on their appearance time of the day and preprocessing them using a tool called Roboflow. This model which was deployed on a Raspberry pi, with the help of PiCamera and IR cameras to detect the animal. To improve the inference speed the model uses the Google Coral edge TPU, achieving an inference speed of 20-25 fps, with a model mAP50 score of 0.93016 at 320x320 resolution. The cost-effective and reliable solution tackles the speed-accuracy trade-off and helps farmers to protect the crops and reduce financial losses with minimal manual interventions. 
The dataset used here was a custom dataset created by collecting raw realtime images (captured using IR cameras and night-vision cameras) from web sources, the images were preprocessed and augmented using Roboflow, you can find the Roboflow link in the Roboflow-README folder. Additionally you can view the images in the below drive link.
